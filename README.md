A fun, interactive birthday card for my 3-year-old nephew

To whom it may concern:

This is an light-hearted and simple birthday card for my 3-year-old nephew. I do not take credit for the complexities of this code, and in fact, want to extend thanks to Alex Ilhan for the template on his website: Email on Acid. You can find the specific page here: https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-development/tutorial-how-to-code-an-interactive-greeting-card-email/

And he even mentions that he got the idea (and majorly tweaked it, for which I am grateful!) from David Walsh at this website: https://davidwalsh.name/css-flip

So if you do happen to see this, and there are any concers, just know it is intended for personal use only. But feel free to reach out to me if there is an issue.

Thanks!
